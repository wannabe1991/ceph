Devices
=======

BlueStore manages either one, two, or (in certain cases) three storage
devices.

In the simplest case, BlueStore consumes a single (primary) storage device.
The storage device is normally used as a whole, occupying the full device that
is managed directly by BlueStore. This *primary device* is normally identified
by a ``block`` symlink in the data directory.

The data directory is a ``tmpfs`` mount which gets populated (at boot time, or
when ``ceph-volume`` activates it) with all the common OSD files that hold
information about the OSD, like: its identifier, which cluster it belongs to,
and its private keyring.

It is also possible to deploy BlueStore across one or two additional devices:

* A *write-ahead log (WAL) device* (identified as ``block.wal`` in the data directory) can be
  used for BlueStore's internal journal or write-ahead log. It is only useful
  to use a WAL device if the device is faster than the primary device (e.g.,
  when it is on an SSD and the primary device is an HDD).
* A *DB device* (identified as ``block.db`` in the data directory) can be used
  for storing BlueStore's internal metadata.  BlueStore (or rather, the
  embedded RocksDB) will put as much metadata as it can on the DB device to
  improve performance.  If the DB device fills up, metadata will spill back
  onto the primary device (where it would have been otherwise).  Again, it is
  only helpful to provision a DB device if it is faster than the primary
  device.

If there is only a small amount of fast storage available (e.g., less
than a gigabyte), we recommend using it as a WAL device.  If there is
more, provisioning a DB device makes more sense.  The BlueStore
journal will always be placed on the fastest device available, so
using a DB device will provide the same benefit that the WAL device
would while *also* allowing additional metadata to be stored there (if
it will fit).  This means that if a DB device is specified but an explicit
WAL device is not, the WAL will be implicitly colocated with the DB on the faster
device.

A single-device (colocated) BlueStore OSD can be provisioned with::

  ceph-volume lvm prepare --bluestore --data <device>

To specify a WAL device and/or DB device, ::

  ceph-volume lvm prepare --bluestore --data <device> --block.wal <wal-device> --block.db <db-device>

.. note:: ``--data`` can be a Logical Volume using  *vg/lv* notation. Other
          devices can be existing logical volumes or GPT partitions.

Provisioning strategies
-----------------------
Although there are multiple ways to deploy a BlueStore OSD (unlike Filestore
which had just one), there are two common arrangements that should help clarify
the deployment strategy:

.. _bluestore-single-type-device-config:

**block (data) only**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If all devices are the same type, for example all rotational drives, and
there are no fast devices to use for metadata, it makes sense to specifiy the
block device only and to not separate ``block.db`` or ``block.wal``. The
:ref:`ceph-volume-lvm` command for a single ``/dev/sda`` device looks like::

    ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data /dev/sda

If logical volumes have already been created for each device, (a single LV
using 100% of the device), then the :ref:`ceph-volume-lvm` call for an LV named
``ceph-vg/block-lv`` would look like::

    ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-vg/block-lv

.. _bluestore-mixed-device-config:

**block and block.db**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have a mix of fast and slow devices (SSD / NVMe and rotational),
it is recommended to place ``block.db`` on the faster device while ``block``
(data) lives on the slower (spinning drive).

You must create these volume groups and logical volumes manually as 
the ``ceph-volume`` tool is currently not able to do so automatically.

For the below example, let us assume four rotational (``sda``, ``sdb``, ``sdc``, and ``sdd``)
and one (fast) solid state drive (``sdx``). First create the volume groups::

    $ vgcreate ceph-block-0 /dev/sda
    $ vgcreate ceph-block-1 /dev/sdb
    $ vgcreate ceph-block-2 /dev/sdc
    $ vgcreate ceph-block-3 /dev/sdd

Now create the logical volumes for ``block``::

    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-0 ceph-block-0
    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-1 ceph-block-1
    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-2 ceph-block-2
    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-3 ceph-block-3

We are creating 4 OSDs for the four slow spinning devices, so assuming a 200GB
SSD in ``/dev/sdx`` we will create 4 logical volumes, each of 50GB::

    $ vgcreate ceph-db-0 /dev/sdx
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-0 ceph-db-0
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-1 ceph-db-0
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-2 ceph-db-0
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-3 ceph-db-0

Finally, create the 4 OSDs with ``ceph-volume``::

    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-0/block-0 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-0
    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-1/block-1 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-1
    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-2/block-2 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-2
    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-3/block-3 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-3

These operations should end up creating four OSDs, with ``block`` on the slower
rotational drives with a 50 GB logical volume (DB) for each on the solid state
drive.

Sizing
======
When using a :ref:`mixed spinning and solid drive setup
<bluestore-mixed-device-config>` it is important to make a large enough
``block.db`` logical volume for BlueStore. Generally, ``block.db`` should have
*as large as possible* logical volumes.

The general recommendation is to have ``block.db`` size in between 1% to 4%
of ``block`` size. For RGW workloads, it is recommended that the ``block.db``
size isn't smaller than 4% of ``block``, because RGW heavily uses it to store
metadata (omap keys). For example, if the ``block`` size is 1TB, then ``block.db`` shouldn't
be less than 40GB. For RBD workloads, 1% to 2% of ``block`` size is usually enough.

In older releases, internal level sizes mean that the DB can fully utilize only
specific partition / LV sizes that correspond to sums of L0, L0+L1, L1+L2,
etc. sizes, which with default settings means roughly 3 GB, 30 GB, 300 GB, and
so forth.  Most deployments will not substantially benefit from sizing to
accomodate L3 and higher, though DB compaction can be facilitated by doubling
these figures to 6GB, 60GB, and 600GB.

Improvements in releases beginning with Nautilus 14.2.12 and Octopus 15.2.6
enable better utilization of arbitrary DB device sizes, and the Pacific
release brings experimental dynamic level support.  Users of older releases may
thus wish to plan ahead by provisioning larger DB devices today so that their
benefits may be realized with future upgrades.

When *not* using a mix of fast and slow devices, it isn't required to create
separate logical volumes for ``block.db`` (or ``block.wal``). BlueStore will
automatically colocate these within the space of ``block``.


Automatic Cache Sizing
======================

BlueStore can be configured to automatically resize its caches when TCMalloc
is configured as the memory allocator and the ``bluestore_cache_autotune``
setting is enabled.  This option is currently enabled by default.  BlueStore
will attempt to keep OSD heap memory usage under a designated target size via
the ``osd_memory_target`` configuration option.  This is a best effort
algorithm and caches will not shrink smaller than the amount specified by
``osd_memory_cache_min``.  Cache ratios will be chosen based on a hierarchy
of priorities.  If priority information is not available, the
``bluestore_cache_meta_ratio`` and ``bluestore_cache_kv_ratio`` options are
used as fallbacks.

``bluestore_cache_autotune``

:Description: Automatically tune the space ratios assigned to various BlueStore
              caches while respecting minimum values.
:Type: Boolean
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``True``

``osd_memory_target``

:Description: When TCMalloc is available and cache autotuning is enabled, try to
              keep this many bytes mapped in memory. Note: This may not exactly
              match the RSS memory usage of the process.  While the total amount
              of heap memory mapped by the process should usually be close
              to this target, there is no guarantee that the kernel will actually
              reclaim  memory that has been unmapped.  During initial development,
              it was found that some kernels result in the OSD's RSS memory
              exceeding the mapped memory by up to 20%.  It is hypothesised
              however, that the kernel generally may be more aggressive about
              reclaiming unmapped memory when there is a high amount of memory
              pressure.  Your mileage may vary.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``4294967296``

``bluestore_cache_autotune_chunk_size``

:Description: The chunk size in bytes to allocate to caches when cache autotune
              is enabled.  When the autotuner assigns memory to various caches,
              it will allocate memory in chunks.  This is done to avoid
              evictions when there are minor fluctuations in the heap size or
              autotuned cache ratios.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``33554432``

``bluestore_cache_autotune_interval``

:Description: The number of seconds to wait between rebalances when cache autotune
              is enabled.  This setting changes how quickly the allocation ratios of
              various caches are recomputed.  Note:  Setting this interval too small
              can result in high CPU usage and lower performance.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``5``

``osd_memory_base``

:Description: When TCMalloc and cache autotuning are enabled, estimate the minimum
              amount of memory in bytes the OSD will need.  This is used to help
              the autotuner estimate the expected aggregate memory consumption of
              the caches.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``805306368``

``osd_memory_expected_fragmentation``

:Description: When TCMalloc and cache autotuning is enabled, estimate the
              percentage of memory fragmentation.  This is used to help the
              autotuner estimate the expected aggregate memory consumption
              of the caches.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``0.15``

``osd_memory_cache_min``

:Description: When TCMalloc and cache autotuning are enabled, set the minimum
              amount of memory used for caches. Note: Setting this value too
              low can result in significant cache thrashing.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``134217728``

``osd_memory_cache_resize_interval``

:Description: When TCMalloc and cache autotuning are enabled, wait this many
              seconds between resizing caches.  This setting changes the total
              amount of memory available for BlueStore to use for caching.  Note
              that setting this interval too small can result in memory allocator
              thrashing and lower performance.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``1``


Manual Cache Sizing
===================

The amount of memory consumed by each OSD for BlueStore caches is
determined by the ``bluestore_cache_size`` configuration option.  If
that config option is not set (i.e., remains at 0), there is a
different default value that is used depending on whether an HDD or
SSD is used for the primary device (set by the
``bluestore_cache_size_ssd`` and ``bluestore_cache_size_hdd`` config
options).

BlueStore and the rest of the Ceph OSD daemon do the best they can
to work within this memory budget.  Note that on top of the configured
cache size, there is also memory consumed by the OSD itself, and
some additional utilization due to memory fragmentation and other
allocator overhead.

The configured cache memory budget can be used in a few different ways:

* Key/Value metadata (i.e., RocksDB's internal cache)
* BlueStore metadata
* BlueStore data (i.e., recently read or written object data)

Cache memory usage is governed by the following options:
``bluestore_cache_meta_ratio`` and ``bluestore_cache_kv_ratio``.
The fraction of the cache devoted to data
is governed by the effective bluestore cache size (depending on
``bluestore_cache_size[_ssd|_hdd]`` settings and the device class of the primary
device) as well as the meta and kv ratios.
The data fraction can be calculated by
``<effective_cache_size> * (1 - bluestore_cache_meta_ratio - bluestore_cache_kv_ratio)``

``bluestore_cache_size``

:Description: The amount of memory BlueStore will use for its cache.  If zero,
              ``bluestore_cache_size_hdd`` or ``bluestore_cache_size_ssd`` will
              be used instead.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``0``

``bluestore_cache_size_hdd``

:Description: The default amount of memory BlueStore will use for its cache when
              backed by an HDD.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``1 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024`` (1 GB)

``bluestore_cache_size_ssd``

:Description: The default amount of memory BlueStore will use for its cache when
              backed by an SSD.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``3 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024`` (3 GB)

``bluestore_cache_meta_ratio``

:Description: The ratio of cache devoted to metadata.
:Type: Floating point
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``.4``

``bluestore_cache_kv_ratio``

:Description: The ratio of cache devoted to key/value data (RocksDB).
:Type: Floating point
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``.4``

``bluestore_cache_kv_max``

:Description: The maximum amount of cache devoted to key/value data (RocksDB).
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``512 * 1024*1024`` (512 MB)


Checksums
=========

BlueStore checksums all metadata and data written to disk.  Metadata
checksumming is handled by RocksDB and uses `crc32c`. Data
checksumming is done by BlueStore and can make use of `crc32c`,
`xxhash32`, or `xxhash64`.  The default is `crc32c` and should be
suitable for most purposes.

Full data checksumming does increase the amount of metadata that
BlueStore must store and manage.  When possible, e.g., when clients
hint that data is written and read sequentially, BlueStore will
checksum larger blocks, but in many cases it must store a checksum
value (usually 4 bytes) for every 4 kilobyte block of data.

It is possible to use a smaller checksum value by truncating the
checksum to two or one byte, reducing the metadata overhead.  The
trade-off is that the probability that a random error will not be
detected is higher with a smaller checksum, going from about one in
four billion with a 32-bit (4 byte) checksum to one in 65,536 for a
16-bit (2 byte) checksum or one in 256 for an 8-bit (1 byte) checksum.
The smaller checksum values can be used by selecting `crc32c_16` or
`crc32c_8` as the checksum algorithm.

The *checksum algorithm* can be set either via a per-pool
``csum_type`` property or the global config option.  For example, ::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> csum_type <algorithm>

``bluestore_csum_type``

:Description: The default checksum algorithm to use.
:Type: String
:Required: Yes
:Valid Settings: ``none``, ``crc32c``, ``crc32c_16``, ``crc32c_8``, ``xxhash32``, ``xxhash64``
:Default: ``crc32c``


Inline Compression
==================

BlueStore supports inline compression using `snappy`, `zlib`, or
`lz4`. Please note that the `lz4` compression plugin is not
distributed in the official release.

Whether data in BlueStore is compressed is determined by a combination
of the *compression mode* and any hints associated with a write
operation.  The modes are:

* **none**: Never compress data.
* **passive**: Do not compress data unless the write operation has a
  *compressible* hint set.
* **aggressive**: Compress data unless the write operation has an
  *incompressible* hint set.
* **force**: Try to compress data no matter what.

For more information about the *compressible* and *incompressible* IO
hints, see :c:func:`rados_set_alloc_hint`.

Note that regardless of the mode, if the size of the data chunk is not
reduced sufficiently it will not be used and the original
(uncompressed) data will be stored.  For example, if the ``bluestore
compression required ratio`` is set to ``.7`` then the compressed data
must be 70% of the size of the original (or smaller).

The *compression mode*, *compression algorithm*, *compression required
ratio*, *min blob size*, and *max blob size* can be set either via a
per-pool property or a global config option.  Pool properties can be
set with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_algorithm <algorithm>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_mode <mode>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_required_ratio <ratio>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_min_blob_size <size>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_max_blob_size <size>

``bluestore_compression_algorithm``

:Description: The default compressor to use (if any) if the per-pool property
              ``compression_algorithm`` is not set. Note that ``zstd`` is *not*
              recommended for BlueStore due to high CPU overhead when
              compressing small amounts of data.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Valid Settings: ``lz4``, ``snappy``, ``zlib``, ``zstd``
:Default: ``snappy``

``bluestore_compression_mode``

:Description: The default policy for using compression if the per-pool property
              ``compression_mode`` is not set. ``none`` means never use
              compression. ``passive`` means use compression when
              :c:func:`clients hint <rados_set_alloc_hint>` that data is
              compressible.  ``aggressive`` means use compression unless
              clients hint that data is not compressible.  ``force`` means use
              compression under all circumstances even if the clients hint that
              the data is not compressible.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Valid Settings: ``none``, ``passive``, ``aggressive``, ``force``
:Default: ``none``

``bluestore_compression_required_ratio``

:Description: The ratio of the size of the data chunk after
              compression relative to the original size must be at
              least this small in order to store the compressed
              version.

:Type: Floating point
:Required: No
:Default: .875

``bluestore_compression_min_blob_size``

              The per-pool property ``compression_min_blob_size`` overrides
              this setting.

:Type: Unsigned Integer

:Default: 0

``bluestore_compression_min_blob_size_hdd``

:Description: Default value of ``bluestore compression min blob size``
              for rotational media.

SPDK Usage
==================

If you want to use the SPDK driver for NVMe devices, you must prepare your system.
Refer to `SPDK document`__ for more details.

.. __: http://www.spdk.io/doc/getting_started.html#getting_started_examples

SPDK offers a script to configure the device automatically. Users can run the
script as root::

  $ sudo src/spdk/scripts/setup.sh

You will need to specify the subject NVMe device's device selector with
the "spdk:" prefix for ``bluestore_block_path``.

For example, you can find the device selector of an Intel PCIe SSD with::

  $ lspci -mm -n -D -d 8086:0953

The device selector always has the form of ``DDDD:BB:DD.FF`` or ``DDDD.BB.DD.FF``.

and then set::

  bluestore_block_path = spdk:0000:01:00.0

Where ``0000:01:00.0`` is the device selector found in the output of ``lspci``
command above.

To run multiple SPDK instances per node, you must specify the
amount of dpdk memory in MB that each instance will use, to make sure each
instance uses its own dpdk memory

In most cases, a single device can be used for data, DB, and WAL.  We describe
this strategy as *colocating* these components. Be sure to enter the below
settings to ensure that all IOs are issued through SPDK.::

  bluestore_block_db_path = ""
  bluestore_block_db_size = 0
  bluestore_block_wal_path = ""
  bluestore_block_wal_size = 0

Otherwise, the current implementation will populate the SPDK map files with
kernel file system symbols and will use the kernel driver to issue DB/WAL IO.
